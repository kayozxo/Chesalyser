## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Stockfish engine (installation varies by OS)

### All Platforms

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kayozxo/chesalyser.git
cd chesalyser

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### OS-Specific Setup

#### **Windows**

1. Download Stockfish:
   - [Official Windows build](https://stockfishchess.org/download/windows/)
   - Extract ZIP and place `stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe` in `/stockfish` folder
2. Update engine path in code:

```python
# In main.py, change:
engine_path = "stockfish/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe"
```

#### **macOS**

```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install stockfish

# Or manual download:
# 1. Get macOS build from https://stockfishchess.org/download/mac/
# 2. Place in project folder under /stockfish
# 3. Make executable:
chmod +x stockfish/stockfish-macos-x86-64
```

#### **Linux**

```bash
# Clone this repository

# Make executable
chmod +x stockfish/stockfish-ubuntu-x86-64-sse41-popcnt
```

### Verify Installation

Set the correct engine path in the code:

```python
# main.py (adjust for your OS)
engine_path = {
    "Windows": "stockfish/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe",
    "macOS": "stockfish/stockfish-macos-x86-64",
    "Linux": "stockfish/stockfish-ubuntu-x86-64-sse41-popcnt"
}[your_os]
```

## 🚀 Usage Notes

- **First Run**: The app may take 30-60 seconds to initialize Stockfish
- **Windows Users**: Add exception for Stockfish in your antivirus if needed
- **M1/M2 Mac Users**: Use Rosetta if using x86 build, or compile ARM version

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Platform-Specific Issues**

| OS      | Common Fixes                                                               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | 1. Add `.exe` extension if missing<br>2. Run as Administrator              |
| macOS   | 1. `xattr -cr stockfish/...` (remove quarantine flags)<br>2. Use ARM build |
| Linux   | 1. Install `libnss3` if missing<br>2. Check 32/64-bit compatibility        |

## 🚀 Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. In the sidebar:

   - Upload PGN file or paste game text
   - Select analysis depth (Beginner to Stockfish mode)
   - Click "ANALYZE GAME"

3. Explore results:
   - Interactive move slider
   - Chess board visualization
   - Move quality assessment
   - Win probability graph
   - Best move suggestions

## 📊 Analysis Metrics

| Metric               | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Win Probability      | White's winning chances based on current evaluation |
| Centipawn Evaluation | Numeric assessment of position advantage            |
| Score Change         | Difference in evaluation from previous move         |
| Piece Moved          | Type of piece moved (Queen, Knight, etc.)           |
| Capture Detection    | Identifies if move resulted in capture              |

## 🛠️ Customization

Modify these components for different behavior:

1. **Analysis Depth Settings** (in `main.py`):

```python
depth_options = {
    10: "Beginner mode",
    15: "Casual mode",
    20: "Serious mode",
    25: "Grandmaster mode",
    30: "Stockfish mode",
}
```

2. **Move Classification Thresholds** (in `classify_move()` function):

```python
# Adjust these values for different move ratings
if is_capture:
    if score_change < 30:  # Modify these thresholds
        return "Best Move", "green"
```

3. **UI Colors** (in `style.css`):

```css
/* Custom gradient effects */
.gradient-header {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to top right, #00f0ff, #0e6fff, #8f5bff);
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. **Stockfish Not Found**:

   - Verify executable path in sidebar settings
   - Ensure correct permissions: `chmod +x stockfish/...`

2. **PGN Parsing Errors**:

   - Validate PGN format using [PGN Validator](https://www.chess.com/pgn-viewer)
   - Ensure game headers are present

3. **Analysis Timeouts**:
   - Reduce analysis depth
   - Use better hardware for deep analysis
