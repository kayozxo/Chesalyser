## üìä Analysis Metrics

| Metric               | Description                                         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Modify these components for different behavior:

1. **Analysis Depth Settings** (in `main.py`):

```python
depth_options = {
    10: "Beginner mode",
    15: "Casual mode",
    20: "Serious mode",
    25: "Grandmaster mode",
    30: "Stockfish mode",
}
```

2. **Move Classification Thresholds** (in `classify_move()` function):

```python
# Adjust these values for different move ratings
if is_capture:
    if score_change < 30:  # Modify these thresholds
        return "Best Move", "green"
```

3. **UI Colors** (in `style.css`):

```css
/* Custom gradient effects */
.gradient-header {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to top right, #00f0ff, #0e6fff, #8f5bff);
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. **Stockfish Not Found**:

   - Verify executable path in sidebar settings
   - Ensure correct permissions: `chmod +x stockfish/...`

2. **PGN Parsing Errors**:

   - Validate PGN format using [PGN Validator](https://www.chess.com/pgn-viewer)
   - Ensure game headers are present

3. **Analysis Timeouts**:
   - Reduce analysis depth
   - Use better hardware for deep analysis
