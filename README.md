## üö® Troubleshooting

**Platform-Specific Issues**

| OS      | Common Fixes                                                               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | 1. Add `.exe` extension if missing<br>2. Run as Administrator              |
| macOS   | 1. `xattr -cr stockfish/...` (remove quarantine flags)<br>2. Use ARM build |
| Linux   | 1. Install `libnss3` if missing<br>2. Check 32/64-bit compatibility        |

## üöÄ Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. In the sidebar:

   - Paste your engine path (linux users: ignore this step)
   - Upload PGN file or paste game text
   - Select analysis depth (Beginner to Stockfish mode)
   - Click "ANALYZE GAME"

3. Explore results:
   - Interactive move slider
   - Chess board visualization
   - Move quality assessment
   - Win probability graph
   - Best move suggestions

## üìä Analysis Metrics

| Metric               | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Win Probability      | White's winning chances based on current evaluation |
| Centipawn Evaluation | Numeric assessment of position advantage            |
| Score Change         | Difference in evaluation from previous move         |
| Piece Moved          | Type of piece moved (Queen, Knight, etc.)           |
| Capture Detection    | Identifies if move resulted in capture              |

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Modify these components for different behavior:

1. **Analysis Depth Settings** (in `main.py`):

```python
depth_options = {
    10: "Beginner mode",
    15: "Casual mode",
    20: "Serious mode",
    25: "Grandmaster mode",
    30: "Stockfish mode",
}
```

2. **Move Classification Thresholds** (in `classify_move()` function):

```python
# Adjust these values for different move ratings
if is_capture:
    if score_change < 30:  # Modify these thresholds
        return "Best Move", "green"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. **Stockfish Not Found**:

   - Verify executable path in sidebar settings
   - Ensure correct permissions: `chmod +x stockfish/...`

2. **PGN Parsing Errors**:

   - Validate PGN format using [PGN Validator](https://www.chess.com/pgn-viewer)
   - Ensure game headers are present

3. **Analysis Timeouts**:
   - Reduce analysis depth
   - Use better hardware for deep analysis
